# CORD-19
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge - NLP data analysis

## Objective
The project aims to derive insights from the research papers related to Covid-19. This set of notebooks provides a data mining process with the help of LDA (Latent Derichlet Analysis). This process parses thousands of research papers and builds topic models that can summarize the content of a research paper in a few biologically relevant keywords. The LDA model can also be used to compare and group similar research articles based on the identified keywords and topics. One of the applications of such grouping is narrowing down the search space with automated topic modeling.<br>
While the current focus is on Covid-19 research articles, this set of notebooks can be used to parse any collection of documents to build topic models.

## Input data
* Research papers related to Covid-19 (source: ?link?)<br>
  * Curated data provided here- keyword_match_data.zip<br>
* Data extracted from the Kegg database - externaldataset.zip

## Usage
The notebooks should be executed in the following order.<br>
